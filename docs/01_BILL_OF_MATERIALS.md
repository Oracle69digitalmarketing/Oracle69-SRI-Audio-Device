# Bill of Materials (BOM)

*Target Cost per Unit: ~$25-35 | Pilot Batch (50 units) Target: ~$1,250 - $1,750*

| Component | Specification | Est. Unit Cost (USD) | Purpose | Source/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Single-Board Computer** | Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W | $15.00 | Core processor | Essential for reliable prototyping. |
| **Power Supply** | 10,000mAh Power Bank | $8.00 | 3-5 days of battery life | Local sourcing preferred. |
| **Audio Output** | Mini USB Speaker (3W) | $3.50 | Clear playback for 1-2 farmers | Wired for reliability. |
| **Input Interface** | 8x Arcade Push Buttons (24mm) | $2.50 | Durable, farmer-friendly input | Color-coded for different SRI steps. |
| **Storage** | 16GB MicroSD Card (Class 10) | $2.00 | Stores all audio files (~100 hrs) | Pre-loaded with content. |
| **Enclosure** | Custom 3D-printed case | $3.00 | Protects components from dust/rain | Simple, vented box design. |
| **Cabling & Misc** | Jumper wires, resistors, switch | $1.00 | Assembly | Basic electronics kit. |
| **Packing & Manual** | Printed quick-start guide | $0.50 | Ease of use | Icons and simple text in local language. |
| **Estimated Total** | | **$35.50** | | *Costs decrease at scale with bulk orders.* |

**Notes:**
*   The BOM reflects **prototype costs**. Mass production (e.g., custom PCB, molded case) could reduce the unit cost below $25.
*   The primary goal is to prove the concept works. The D-Prize grant of ~$20,000 comfortably covers the pilot batch of 50 units with budget for content and operations.
