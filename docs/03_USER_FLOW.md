# User Flow: How a Farmer Uses the Device

**Design Goal:** Complete, intuitive interaction in under 10 seconds, with zero written instructions.

## The Physical Device
*   A rugged, handheld box.
*   A **physical key switch** on the side for power.
*   **6-8 large, colored buttons** on top. Each has:
    *   A simple icon (e.g., water droplet, plant seedling).
    *   A number (1-6).
    *   A label in the local language (e.g., "Omi" for Water).
*   A **small LED** to indicate power.
*   A **speaker grille**.

## Step-by-Step Interaction
1.  **POWER ON**
    *   *Farmer Action:* Turns the physical key.
    *   *Device Response:* The power LED lights up. The device is now ready.

2.  **SELECT A LESSON**
    *   *Farmer Action:* Looks at the buttons and presses the one for the task they need (e.g., the blue button labeled "3: Omi" for water management).
    *   *Device Response:* Immediately begins playing the clear, pre-recorded instruction in Yoruba/Ijaw.

3.  **LISTEN & LEARN**
    *   *Farmer Action:* Listens to the ~60-second instruction. Can hold the device close to their ear or place it in the middle of a group.
    *   *Device Response:* Plays the audio to completion. The button's LED might blink during playback.

4.  **REPEAT OR CHOOSE ANOTHER**
    *   *Farmer Action:* Can press the **same button** to replay the lesson, or press a **different button** for a new lesson.
    *   *Device Response:* Plays the newly selected audio file.

5.  **POWER OFF**
    *   *Farmer Action:* Turns the key switch to the off position when finished.
    *   *Device Response:* The LED turns off. The device consumes negligible power.

## Key Design Wins
*   **No Menus, No Screens:** Eliminates all complexity.
*   **Instant Feedback:** Audio starts immediately on button press.
*   **Forgiving:** Buttons can be pressed in any order, any number of times.
*   **Shareable:** Easy for a lead farmer to play lessons for a group.
